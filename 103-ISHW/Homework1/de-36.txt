FORKS TRACE THEIR ORIGINS BACK TO THE ANCIENT GREEKS. FORKS AT THAT TIME WERE FAIRLY LARGE WITH TWO TINES THAT AIDED IN THE CARVING OF MEAT IN THE KITCHEN. THE TINES PREVENTED MEAT FROM TWISTING OR MOVING DURING CARVING AND ALLOWED FOOD TO SLIDE OFF MORE EASILY THAN IT WOULD WITH A KNIFE. 
BY THE SEVENTH CENTURY A.D., ROYAL COURTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST BEGAN TO USE FORKS AT THE TABLE FOR DINING. FROM THE TENTH THROUGH THE THIRTEENTH CENTURIES, FORKS WERE FAIRLY COMMON AMONG THE WEALTHY IN BYZANTIUM. IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY, A BYZANTINE WIFE BROUGHT FORKS TO ITALY; HOWEVER, THEY WERE NOT WIDELY ADOPTED THERE UNTIL THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. THEN IN FIFTEEN THIRTY THREE, FORKS WERE BROUGHT FROM ITALY TO FRANCE. THE FRENCH WERE ALSO SLOW TO ACCEPT FORKS, FOR USING THEM WAS THOUGHT TO BE AWKWARD. 
IN SIXTEEN EIGHT, FORKS WERE BROUGHT TO ENGLAND BY THOMAS, WHO SAW THEM DURING HIS TRAVELS IN ITALY. THE ENGLISH FIRST RIDICULED FORKS AS BEING UNNECESSARY. ¡§WHY SHOULD A PERSON NEED A FORK WHEN GOD HAD GIVEN HIM HANDS?¡¨ THEY ASKED. SLOWLY, HOWEVER, FORKS CAME TO BE ADOPTED BY THE WEALTHY AS A SYMBOL OF THEIR SOCIAL STATUS. THEY WERE PRIZED POSSESSIONS MADE OF EXPENSIVE MATERIALS INTENDED TO IMPRESS GUESTS. BY THE MID SIXTEEN HUNDREDS, EATING WITH FORKS WAS CONSIDERED FASHIONABLE AMONG THE WEALTHY BRITISH. 
EARLY TABLE FORKS WERE MODELED AFTER KITCHEN FORKS, BUT SMALL PIECES OF FOOD OFTEN FELL THROUGH THE TWO TINES OR SLIPPED OFF EASILY. IN LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FRANCE, LARGER FORKS WITH FOUR CURVED TINES WERE DEVELOPED. THE ADDITIONAL TINES MADE DINERS LESS LIKELY TO DROP FOOD, AND THE CURVED TINES SERVED AS A SCOOP SO PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE TO CONSTANTLY SWITCH TO A SPOON WHILE EATING. BY THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY, FOUR-TINED FORKS HAD ALSO BEEN DEVELOPED IN GERMANY AND ENGLAND AND SLOWLY BEGAN TO SPREAD TO AMERICA.
