The rar file is a compressed file of images (in the format of PGM).
The file names leading with 't' can be used as the templates for matching, while those leading with numerals are images for testing.
Enjoy your testing!

You can use the freeware IvanView1.2 (http://www.ivanview.com/pgm.html) to view the images.
